## **Description**



Introducing "Beauty Paradise," a cutting-edge platform for scheduling appointments at beauty salons that optimizes staff schedules and salon management while streamlining the client booking process. Customers can easily schedule, modify, and cancel appointments using our user-friendly application, which also gives them the option to look up staff profiles and learn more about our services and prices. Change how beauty visits are handled by choosing Beauty Paradise!



---

### Motivation?: 
- Beauty Paradise was created out of a wish to improve the client and salon owner experience in beauty salons. We observed that the conventional appointment scheduling procedure was frequently inconvenient and time-consuming, entailing back-and-forth phone calls, the absence of preferred time slots, and limited understanding of services and staff expertise. Additionally, managing appointments, scheduling, and keeping track of customer preferences were challenges for salon owners and employees. 
### Why?:
- Working on this project allows you to collaborate with other developers, improving your teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills. Employers value developers who can work effectively in a team and contribute to shared goals.
### What problem does it solve?:
- Developing a well-designed and flexible application allows salon owners to scale their business more easily, adding new services, locations, or staff members as needed.
### What did you learn?
- Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
- Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.
- Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
- Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
- Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.
- Have a polished UI.
- Be responsive.
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
- Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
- Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
